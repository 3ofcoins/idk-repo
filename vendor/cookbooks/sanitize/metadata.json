{"name":"sanitize","description":"Sanitizes system by providing a sane default configuration","long_description":"Description\n===========\n\nThis cookbook aims to normalize setup of a fresh server and set sane\ndefaults for global settings, and work with various initial\nenvironments (tested on EC2 images, Hetzner \"minimal\" installations,\nand debootstrap-created LXC images). At the moment it supports only\nUbuntu, Debian support is planned.\n\nIt calls recipes `chef-client::config` and `omnibus_updater`, and\nworks only with Omnibus Chef client package.\n\nThis cookbook is developed on GitHub at\nhttps://github.com/3ofcoins/chef-cookbook-sanitize\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n* apt\n* chef-client\n* iptables\n* omnibus_updater\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n* `sanitize.iptables` -- if false, does not install and configure\n  iptables; defaults to true.\n\n* `sanitize.keep_access` -- if true, don't disable direct access users\n  (ubuntu user or root password); defaults to false.\n\n* `sanitize.ports` -- if `sanitize.iptables` is true, specifies TCP\n  ports to open. It is a dictionary, where keys are port numbers or\n  service names, and values can be:\n  \n  * `true` -- open port for any source address\n  * `false` -- close port\n  * a string -- will be used as `--src` argument to `iptables`\n  * an array of strings -- for many different `--src` entries\n  * **TODO:** It should be possible to specify a node search query\n  \n  Default:\n  \n  ```ruby\n  default['sanitize']['ports']['ssh'] = true\n  ```\n\n* `sanitize.apt_repositories` -- dictionary of APT repositories to\n  add. Key is repository name, value is remaining attributes of the\n  `apt_repository` resource provided by the `apt` cookbook (see\n  http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/apt). If you set\n  `distribution` to `\"lsb_codename\"`, `node['lsb']['codename']`\n  attribute will be used instead. Example:\n  \n    :sanitize => {\n      :apt_repositories => {\n        :percona => {\n          :uri => 'http://repo.percona.com/apt',\n          :distribution => 'lsb_codename',\n          :components => [ 'main' ],\n          :deb_src => true,\n          :keyserver => 'hkp://keys.gnupg.net',\n          :key => '1C4CBDCDCD2EFD2A'\n        }}}\n\n* `sanitize.install_packages` -- a list of packages to install on all\n  machines; defaults to an empty list.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nInclude `recipe[sanitize]` in your run list after your user accounts\nare created and sudo and ssh is configured, and otherwise as early as\npossible. In particular, if you use `omnibus_updater` cookbook, it\nshould be after `sanitize` in the run list.\n\nsanitize::default\n-----------------\n\nThis is the default \"base settings\" setup. It should be called\n**after** shell user accounts and sudo are configured, as it locks\ndefault login user and direct root access.\n\n1.  Deletes `ubuntu` system user\n2.  Locks system password for `root` user (assumes that only sudo is\n    used to elevate privileges)\n3.  Ensure all FHS-provided directories exist by creating some that\n    have been found missing on some of the installation (namely,\n    `/opt`)\n4.  Sets locale to `en_US.UTF-8`, generates this locale, sets time zone\n    to UTC\n5.  Changes mode of `/var/log/chef/client.log` to `0600` -- readable\n    only for root, as it may contain sensitive data\n6.  Deletes annoying `motd.d` files\n7.  Installs vim and sets it as a default system editor\n8.  Installs and configures iptables, opens SSH port (optional, but\n    enabled by default)\n9.  Installs `can-has` command as a symlink to `apt-get`\n10. Runs `chef-client::config` and `omnibus_updater` recipes\n\nRoadmap\n=======\n\nPlans for future, in no particular order:\n\n* Depend on and include `openssh-server`; configure SSH known hosts,\n  provide sane SSH server and client configuration defaults\n* Provide hooks (definitions / LWRP / library) for other cookbooks for\n  commonly used facilities, such as opening up common ports, \"backend\"\n  http service, SSL keys management, maybe some other \"library\"\n  functions like helpers for encrypted data bags\n* Test with test-kitchen\n","maintainer":"Maciej Pasternacki","maintainer_email":"maciej@pasternacki.net","license":"MIT","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 10.04"},"dependencies":{"apt":">= 0.0.0","chef-client":">= 0.0.0","iptables":">= 0.0.0","omnibus_updater":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"version":"0.4.0"}
